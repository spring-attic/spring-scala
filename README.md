# Spring Scala

The goal of Spring Scala is to make it easier to use the Spring framework in Scala.

**Spring Scala development within Pivotal has ceased, but fortunately a member
of the community - Paul Snively - has stepped up and is continuing development
over at
[https://hub.darcs.net/psnively/spring-scala](https://hub.darcs.net/psnively/spring-scala).
Please refer to that repository instead of this one, which might be removed in the future.**
